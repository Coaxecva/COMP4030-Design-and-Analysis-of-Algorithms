When Permutations(i) is called, it is assumed that Solution[0], Solution[1], ..., Solution[i]
have been configured.   Then, Permutations(i) will print all possible permutations having this
partial configuration.

Example:  Solution[0] = 3, Solution[1] = 0.
Permutations(1) prints out [3,0,1,2], [3,0,2,1]
